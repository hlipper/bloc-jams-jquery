# bloc-jams-jquery
A starter project for Bloc's jQuery-driven music player app


Hello!

For this project, I worked with a fork of the bloc-jams-jquery codebase to create interactive features for a simple mp3 
playback app.

I used HTML5, Javascript and jQuery to create the interactive song list UI, the playback controls, volume and playback sliders, 
and durations in minutes and seconds.
